This README file contains information on the contents of the
meta-neurio layer which is currently being used to customize
features of the Freescale core-image-base but should be usable 
for any image build.

I. Adding the neurio layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the neurio layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the neurio layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the neurio layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-neurio \
    "
